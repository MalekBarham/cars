 <p>According to BuyaCar.co, Another term in the US for the popular family vehicle is the "sport-ute." SUV is a loose term that traditionally covers a broad range of vehicles with four-wheel drive that can be taken off-road and have the feel of a lighter truck. While the term SUV can be applied to larger vehicles, such as the Range Rover, Chevrolet Suburban, and Jeep-like SUVs, it can also apply to smaller vehicles that don't have four-wheel drive and have a minimal capability of going off-road like the Honda CRV and crossover SUVs. Sport-utility is more than just a technical term for the SUV. It also means that the vehicle can get things done and has a quality made for the outdoors, such as scaling different terrains.</p>
